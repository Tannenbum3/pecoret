      This technical summary provides an overview of the findings resulting from the pentest conducted on the defined
      assets.
      Throughout the test, our team of skilled ethical hackers simulated real-world attacks on various targets within
      scope. The approach included a combination of automated
      vulnerability scanning, manual testing, and exploitation techniques to ascertain the level of resilience against
      potential malicious actors.

      It should be noted that quantifying the overall business risk posed by any of the issues found in any test is
      outside
      our scope. This means that some risks may be reported as high from a technical perspective but may, as a result
      of other controls unknown to us, be considered acceptable by the business.

          Critical vulnerabilities can lead to a full compromise of the asset.

          High-risk vulnerabilities pose a serious threat to the target.

          Vulnerabilities indicated with this severity level pose a medium risk to the target.
          Typically, these vulnerabilities depend on other factors that must be present for successful exploitation.
          These vulnerabilities should be resolved throughout the ongoing maintenance process.

          Low severity vulnerabilities pose a minimal risk to the target and are often theoretical in nature.
          These vulnerabilities should be addressed as part of routine maintenance tasks.
